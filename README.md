# CEDA Tools
This contains the code general code used to extract and format data from electronic healthcare records (EHRs) from the Providence St. Joseph Healthcare System (PSJH). These code are used to enable analyses using the EHRs to evaluate healthcare outcomes and published in papers from the Hadlock Lab at the Institute for Systems Biology and collaborators. Results are aggregated and reported within associated papers to the extent possible while maintaining privacy from personal health information (PHI) as required by law. All data is archived within PSJH systems in a HIPAA-secure audited compute environment to facilitate verification of study conclusions. Due to the sensitive nature of the data we are unable to share the data used in these analyses, although, all scripts used to conduct the analyses using these tools are shared herein.
